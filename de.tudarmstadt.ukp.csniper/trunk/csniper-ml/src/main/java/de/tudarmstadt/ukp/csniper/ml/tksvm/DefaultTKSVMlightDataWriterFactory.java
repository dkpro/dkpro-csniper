 *          A Factory class for creating a tree kernel support vector model light data writer.
 * 
 *          It uses a TreeFeatureVector as it's feature vector which includes a SpareFeatureVector.
 *          In addition it uses the following encoders for it's non tree features: NumberEncoder,
 *          BooleanEncoder and StringEncoder. The default value for the cutoff is 5 (i.e. features
 *          that occur less than this number of times over the entire training set will not be
 *          encoded during testing). And it also uses a EuclideanNormalizer.
 * @deprecated Use {@link DefaultDataWriterFactory} with {@link TKSVMlightDataWriter}.
