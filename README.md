## Draft for a new DKPro Core website

This is a fork of [Feeling Responsive][1], which is licensed under [MIT license][2].
It is a template for Jekyll (used by github) to build static pages.

A few ToDos:
* Discuss colors
* Discuss font family for headers
* Front page icons: same color (grey? +1), centered, no shadows, maybe a bit smaller
* Discuss frontpage layout
	* SH: Splash page?
* Fix links not working in subheader/intro
* Discuss menu structure, site content
	* Submenu items?
* atm content pages use markdown. There exists a plugin for asciidoc ([jekyll-asciidoc][3]), but it is not supported by github-jekyll yet - the site would have to be built offline, then uploaded. This could probably be done using Jenkins?
	* For now weÄºl make do with markdown.
* Work on sidebar, footer
	* Mailing lists in footer
* Check/Solve iOS problems
* Add content...
