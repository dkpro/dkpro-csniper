## Draft for a new DKPro Core website

This is a fork of [Feeling Responsive][1], which is licensed under [MIT license][2].
It is a template for Jekyll (used by github) to build static pages.

A few ToDos:
* Discuss frontpage layout
* Discuss menu structure, site content
* atm content pages use markdown. There exists a plugin for asciidoc ([jekyll-asciidoc])[3], but it is not supported by github-jekyll yet - the site would have to be built offline, then uploaded. This could probably be done using Jenkins?
* Work on sidebar, footer
* Add content...
