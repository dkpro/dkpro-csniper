			<h4>Quality control settings</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Participation threshold</b>: percentage of users who have to
					assess an item as <i>Correct</i> or <i>Wrong</i> for it to be
					considered <i>Correct</i>, <i>Wrong</i> or <i>Disputed</i>. If less
					than the given percentage of users have voted either <i>Correct</i>
					and <i>Wrong</i>, an item is considered <i>Incomplete</i>.</li>
				<li><b>Confidence threshold</b>: percentage of assessments the
					majority vote has to have over the minority. If it is set to 0,
					only items with a tie between <i>Correct</i> and <i>Wrong</i> votes
					are considered <i>Disputed</i>. If this is set to 1, any item which
					has not been voted for unanimously, is considered <i>Disputed</i>.
					A value of 0.5 indicates that an item is <i>Disputed</i> if one
					class (<i>Correct</i> or <i>Wrong</i>) has not at least twice as
					many votes as the other.<br /> Confidence is computed as
					abs(correct-wrong)/max(correct,wrong).</li>
			</ul>
			Consider the following example:<br /><br /> 10 testers, with 5 voting <i>Correct</i>
			and 3 voting <i>Wrong</i>, 2 having not voted.<br />
			The user ratio is (5+3)/10 = 0.8, and the confidence ratio is (5-3)/max(5,3) = 2/5 = 0.4.
			<br /><br /> We will show 3 scenarios:<br />
			<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
				<li>Participation threshold = 0.3, Confidence threshold = 0.6.<br />
					The item is labeled as <i>Disputed</i>, because the user ratio is high enough
					[0.8 &gt; 0.3] but the confidence ratio is not [0.4 &lt; 0.6].<br /><br />
				</li>
				<li>Participation threshold = 0.9, Confidence threshold = 0.4.<br />
					The item is labeled as <i>Incomplete</i>, because the user ratio is not high
					enough [0.8 &lt; 0.9].<br /><br />
				</li>
				<li>Participation threshold = 0.6, Confidence threshold = 0.3<br /> The
					The item is labeled as <i>Correct</i>, because the user ratio is high enough
					[0.8 &gt; 0.6], the confidence ratio is high enough [0.4 &gt; 0.3], and the
					there are more <i>Correct</i> than <i>Wrong</i> votes.<br /><br />
